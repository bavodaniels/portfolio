Since launching my career as a Java consultant in 2014, I've been deeply immersed in the AWS ecosystem, evolving into an AWS Solutions Architect with a passion for translating client requirements into robust, scalable cloud solutions. As a certified AWS Solutions Architect Professional, I bring both technical depth and strategic thinking to every challenge.
Currently serving as Tech Lead and Solutions Architect for my team, I believe the best solutions emerge from collective expertise. I foster an environment where every team member has a voice, and we move forward with decisions the team stands behind ensuring not just technical excellence, but genuine ownership and commitment.
Beyond architecture and leadership, I'm increasingly drawn to the cybersecurity dimension of cloud solutions, exploring how to build systems that are not only efficient and scalable, but fundamentally secure. I've also had the privilege of mentoring multiple intern teams, helping guide the next generation of technologists toward successful careers.
